# this script will contain two simulations
# the first simulation will be to set the environmental
# conditions. This includes water level, quality, and soil
# moisture. The second simulation will be the system's
# automated reaction. This includes pulling 'sensor' data
# and triggering reactions to data inputs.

# the entire system will be looped to simulate a reaction
# to environmental inputs:
#for i in range(0,10):
